= Random Testing for Narrative Games

`dendry_random_player.py`: selenium-based random player for dendry

`twine_random_player.py`: selenium-based random player for Twine/Sugarcube

`node_graph_builder.py`: function to generate a scene dependency graph from a set of random playtraces (very naive implementation for now)

`pageant_analysis.ipynb`, `nye2019_analysis.ipynb`, and `social_democracy_analysis.ipynb`: analysis results for the random testing runs on these three games (using dendry's builtin random testing).

`bee/analytics.ipynb`: analytics results for Bee (using selenium-based random testing)
